# WebXR Feature Incubation: Real World Geometry

Feature lead: John Pallet (@johnpallett)

This is a feature incubation repo for the [Immersive Web community group](https://www.w3.org/community/immersive-web/), as described in [this README](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/blob/master/README.md) about how we collaborate and find concensus about ideas and technologies.

The goal of this feature incubation is to iteratively explore and eventually define access to world geometry like planes and meshes in the WebXR Device API.
